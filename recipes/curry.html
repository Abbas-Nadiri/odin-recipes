    <p> Chicken curry served with rice and leafy greens.</p>
    <p>
        This authentic chicken curry recipe is a banger. This specific style of 
        curry is common in Pakistan where it is a staple food and made in 
        every household. And it's no wonder. The myriad of spices that make up
        the backbone of this dish's fragrance are fresh and exciting.

        <li>Add the garlic and ginger paste and fry lightly just until fragrant,
            then immediately add the chicken to avoid burning it.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for a minute, then add all of the spices along with salt 
            to taste and fry lightly just till the spices release their fragrance.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomato and fry until the released water has evaporated. </li>
        <li>Add the yoghurt now and stir till combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and turn the heat down to low. Let it simmer for 
            15-20 minutes or until the chicken is tender.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with plain naan or rice.</li>
