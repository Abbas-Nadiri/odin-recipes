    <p> Chicken curry served with rice and leafy greens.</p>
    <p>
        This authentic chicken curry recipe is a banger. This specific style of 
        curry is common in Pakistan where it is a staple food and made in 
        every household. And it's no wonder. The myriad of spices that make up
        the backbone of this dish's fragrance are fresh and exciting.

        Get ready for a one-way trip to flavourtown, which happens to be on a 
        street in Islamabad. Who would've guessed.
